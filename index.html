        <h4>Nepal reports 217 new Covid-19 cases, two deaths
        </h4>
        <p>According to the Health Ministry, the countrywide death toll has now reached 11,579 and the number of active
          cases
          stands at 5,185.
          Children aged five to 11, who are in a clinical risk group, or who are a household contact of someone who is
          immunosuppressed, should be offered a Covid vaccine, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation
          (JCVI) has
          said.

          Further advice regarding Covid vaccination for other five to 11-year-olds will be issued in due course after
          consideration of additional data, and on the Omicron variant more broadly, officials said.

        <p>The Bajhang branch of Hulak Bachat Bank, a financial unit under the Postal Services Department, lured

        <h4>Australian Open confident on Nadal, uncertain on Djokovic
        </h4>
        <p>Roger Federer, the other men's player with 20 Grand Slam titles, and Serena Williams, who has won 23 Grand
          Slam titles,
          have already ruled themselves out of the tournament as they continue their recoveries from injury.“The man,
          who tested positive for Covid-19 was under surveillance,” Dr Samir Kumar Adhikari, joint-spokesperson for the
          Health Ministry, told the Post. “Whole-genome sequencing carried out at the National Public Health Laboratory
          confirmed
          that the man was infected with the Omicron variant.”

          The ministry refused to reveal further details but said that the man had returned from a country highly
          affected by
          Omicron.

          “Contact tracing has already started,” said Dr Sangita Mishra, spokesperson for the Health Ministry.

          Mishra did not provide travel history details of the infected person.

          The Health Ministry said ever since the emergence of Omicron, 2,038 swab samples of infected persons have been
          analysed
          for S-gene target failure.
